# edpart
Ed's recursive partitioning and regression trees package to reproduce some results of the [rpart package.](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.rpart) The edpart package is incomplete and will probably never be completed. It is written purely in R with no dependencies, so it might be useful for self-study. If you are interested in citing this package, I would prefer that you cite the paper below instead (the package was used to write the paper):
